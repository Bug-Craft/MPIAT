You can try it out, but don't use it too frequently, otherwise my server may not be able to handle it.
Open this web demo link and fill in the input box with the genuine username of Minecraft Java version. Then press the button.
You can also deploy it to your HTTP server for more people to use.
## Deploy to your HTTP server
You need to install PHP, which is the most important thing.
I have only tested PHP 8, so I am not sure if other versions will work properly.
And Nginx or Apache, as well as other HTTP servers that support PHP.
Upload PHP files to the document directory of the HTTP server.
And enable the openssl extension in php.ini.
Now you can use it.
## Does it comply with Minecraft EULA?
Yes. But this is my own judgment, after all, it is only calling the official API of Mojang.
Just like the Minecraft Java version client.
## Some other things
This is my first time writing PHP, and I basically don't know HTML.
So this may seem simple, but it is real and effective.
I hope it can help you.
If you could optimize it, it would be great.
Thank you for your use.
